Personal project built during the 5DCC to put in pratice what I have learned during this course and others since I started to learn coding for Front End developement.

The 5 Day Coding Challenge Event were held by Code Institute, where they teach the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  to start the learning process in programming

This was my second front end project. I started from the Skills that I have learned during this 2 firsts months from the complete zero Knowledge in coding to this brilhant Project! I am very excited to finish it!

27 Setemper to 01 october 2022.
